# This property tells EFM which OS user owns the $PGDATA dir for the
# 'db.database'.  By default, the owner is either 'postgres' for PostgreSQL
# or 'enterprisedb' for EDB Postgres Advanced Server.  However, if you
# have configured your db to run as a different user, you will need to
# copy the /etc/sudoers.d/efm-XX conf file to grant the
# necessary permissions to your db owner.
#
# This username must have write permission to the 'db.recovery.conf.dir'
# specified below.

# Specify the proper service name in order to use service commands rather
# than pg_ctl to start/stop/restart a database. For example, if this property
# is set, then 'service <name> restart' or 'systemctl restart <name>'
# (depending on OS version) will be used to restart the database rather than pg_ctl.
# This property is required unless db.bin is set.
db.service.name=

# Specify the directory containing the pg_ctl command, for example:
# /usr/pgsql-9.5/bin. Unless the db.service.name property is used, the pg_ctl
# command is used to start/stop/restart databases as needed after a
# failover or switchover. This property is required unless db.service.name
# is set.
db.bin=

# Specify the location of the db recovery.conf file on the node. On
# a standby node, the trigger file location is read from the file in
# this directory. After a failover, the recovery.conf files on
# remaining standbys are changed to point to the new master db (a copy
# of the original is made first). On a master node, a recovery.conf file will
# be written during failover and promotion to ensure that the master node can
# not be restarted as the master database.

# Use the jdbc.ssl property to enable ssl for EFM connections. Setting
# this property to true will force the agents to use 'ssl=true' for all
# JDBC database connections (to both local and remote databases).
# When jdbc.ssl is true (and ssl is enabled), the jdbc.ssl.mode property will
# determine how server certificates are handled. Valid values are:
#
# verify-ca - EFM will perform CA verification before allowing the
#             certificate. This is the default value in case ssl
#             is used and the mode property is not set.

# This property specifies the ip address and port that jgroups

# then the main thread makes a final check with a timeout value

# EFM nodes.
#
# There are many reasons why this node might not be considered reachable:
# firewalls might be blocking the request, ICMP might be filtered out,
# etc.

# manager will back up recovery.conf, change the host parameter
# of the primary_conninfo entry, and restart the database. The
# restart command is contained in either the efm_db_functions or
# efm_root_functions file; default when not running db as an os
# service is: "pg_ctl restart -m fast -w -t <timeout> -D <directory>"
# where the timeout is the local.timeout property value and the
# directory is specified by db.recovery.conf.dir. To turn off
# automatic reconfiguration, set this property to false.

# A standby with this set to false will not be added to the failover
# priority list, and so will not be available for promotion. The
# property will be used whenever an agent starts as a standby or
# resumes as a standby after being idle. After startup/resume, the
# node can still be added or removed from the priority list with the
# 'efm set-priority' command. This property is required for all
# non-witness nodes.
promotable=true

# Instead of setting specific standbys as being unavailable for
# promotion, this property can be used to set a minimum number

# promotion will not happen if it will drop the number of standbys
# below this value. This property must be the same on each node.

# Absolute path to fencing script run during promotion
#
# This is an optional user-supplied script that will be run during
# failover on the standby database node.  If left blank, no action will
# be taken.  If specified, EFM will execute this script before promoting
# the standby. The script is run as the efm user.
#
# Parameters can be passed into this script for the failed master and
# new primary node addresses. Use %p for new primary and %f for failed
# master. On a node that has just been promoted, %p should be the same
# as the node's efm binding address.

# Example:
# script.fence=/somepath/myscript %p %f

# Absolute path to fencing script run after promotion
#
# This is an optional user-supplied script that will be run after
# failover on the standby node after it has been promoted and
# is no longer in recovery. The exit code from this script has
# no effect on failover manager, but will be included in a notification
# sent after the script executes.  The script is run as the efm user.
#
# Parameters can be passed into this script for the failed master and
# new primary node addresses. Use %p for new primary and %f for failed
# master. On a node that has just been promoted, %p should be the same
# as the node's efm binding address.
#
# Example:
# script.post.promotion=/somepath/myscript %f %p

# Absolute path to script run on isolated master
